#### In supervised learning, the input data already has a paired outcome, which is plugged in to train the model to predict outcomes in new datasets. For example, we want to build a model that, when given unfamiliar data, can accurately predict the outcomes.

### In unsupervised learning, there are two key differences from the above approach:

    - There are no paired inputs and outcomes.
    - The model uses a whole dataset as input.

### Unsupervised learning is used in one of the following two ways:

    - Transform the data to create an intuitive representation for analysis or to use in another machine learning model; or
    - Cluster or determine patterns in a grouping of data, rather than to predict a classification.



## Types of Unsupervised Learning: Transformations and Clustering

### Transformations
We use transformations when we need to take raw data and make it easier to understand. Transformations also can help prepare data so that it can be used for other machine learning algorithms. 
For example, if you had cable TV viewer data, it might contain location, viewing duration, and viewer churn and retention during commercials and after programs ended. 
Transformations can reduce the dimensional representation, which simply means weâ€™ll be decreasing the number of features used for the model or analysis. After doing so, the data can either be processed for use in other algorithms or narrowed down so it can be viewed in 2D.

### Clustering Algorithms
We use clustering algorithms to group similar objects into clusters. For example, if a cable service wants to group those with similar viewing habits, we would use a clustering algorithm.
